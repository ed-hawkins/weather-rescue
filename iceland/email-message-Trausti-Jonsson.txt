Hi Phil.
  The data I sent to the ISPDv4 a few years ago were Stykkisholmur 1845 to 1873 (all barometers), Reykjavik 1820 to 1854 (one per day) and Akureyri 1851 to 1854. These should all be there - if not I can send it again. 
  Akureyri 1807 to 1814 has also been digitised (3 obs per day). Pressure observations from the period 1806 to 1870 that remain to be digitised are Ketilsstadir (E-Iceland) 1829 to 1833, (3 per day) Möðruvellir (N-Iceland) 1829 to 1833 (3 or 4 per day), Akureyri 1848-1850 (if I remember the years correctly) and a set of sub-daily observations from Reykjavik for a few years in the 1840s. The last- mentioned were accurate enough to see the daily average atmospheric tidal wave (that we still see). 
  In addition there are a few pressure observations from southern Iceland pre-1810, probably not useful at this stage, but possibly in the more advanced future. 
  I recall sending Ed (I think it was him) the synoptic message pressure data that we have digitized from the years 1906 to 1919.
  The ISPDv4 also (I think) includes the old WASA-dataset that included daily data from Stykkisholmur 1874 to 1919 (and later). This was digitized from the published yearbooks - which include more undigitized pressure data. The yearbooks have all been imaged and are available on the internet:

and 1920 to 1923:

We have recently completed the imaging of most of the original observation journals for 1873 to 1948 - and it is quite feasible to digitize the pressure observations of these. I attach an image of pressure observations in Reykjavik in 1886 as an example. 
 
We have digitized all daily precipitation measurements in Iceland from their begining in the 19th century - but the quality checking is lax. 
 
If Rob is interested in these images I can try to transfer those including pressure observations to him (or other persons involved in the digitization effort)
 
I hope that we can continue with the imaging, there are still some observational series pre-1873 (mainly temperature) that have not been looked at and there are also the barographs - which contain a lot of information.
