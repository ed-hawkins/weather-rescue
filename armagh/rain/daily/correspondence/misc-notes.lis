	''These corrections have evidently not been applied to the

	Re. round rain gauge measurement for this day:'lost' .

	After this date, in the column reading 'square on lawn' only

			Corrections
	''By 36 observations in April & May 1871 the corrections of the
	Max. & Min. thermometers as referred to the standard
	thermometer were: Max -2.961 Min. -0.594.''

       ''These corrections have evidently not been applied to the
       readings, for I find by comparing with the Max. & Min. of the
       'Hourly Readings' for April & May 1881 the corr. to the old
       instrs. to be  -3.2 (deg) & -0.3 .''
				J.L.E.D.

October 1865
	'The reading of the square gauge for 29th : was assumed as that
	of the Round inst. when adding up the sum total.'

January 4 1867
	'N.B.  At these low temperatures the minimum therm.: was
	observed to read in excess of E.'

October 1867
	'The Round gauge assumed on the 9th inpt(?). for the square.'

November 9 1870
	Wet bulb therm. frozen.  10 1870 Wet bulb frozen.  14 Ice in
	square gauge.

December 13 1870
	Cock (square) gauge open.

July 28 1871
	Cock of gauge (round) leaking, settled it.

April 1874
	Re. rain gauges: 'As in next (month) a crack was found in
	bottom of gauges haven taken the quantity of R. gauge for the
	square.'

May 1874
	'Found the bottom of the gauge cracked, so sent it to Donelly
	to be soldered.'
	From the beginning of May the Round rain gauge has been
	replaced by a Kew automatic. Although there is no quote
	relating this, the heading in the column notes the change and
	also a table at rear of the book.

June 15 1877

Inside front cover:

'Up to Oct. 1, 1882 the instruments in use were the Barometer by
Newman, a standard thermometer, a Dry & Wet by Jones. After Oct. 1,
1882 the instruments in use are those belonging to the Meteorol.(sic)
office, viz. Bar. Adie 1237, Stand Therms. Cassella 391-2, Max.
Negretti 3404, Min. Cassella 427.'
	'Since january 1885: Dry Bulb B.J. 3256. Wet 3254. same Max. &
	Min.'

January 27 1881
	This is all that fell since the 12th as the pin of gauge
	(square) was frozen fast. The red figures are the 0.287 divided
	in the ratio of the Kew numbers.'

October 1882
	'During the last 3 months of 1882 the observations were taken
	at 10a.m. and 10p.m. Greenwich time, & with the instruments
	belonging to to the Meteor. office & used as standards in the
	tabulations of the 'Hourly Readings'.

From January 1 1883 to December 31 1883 ther are no readings in this
book for any values except rainfall, Max. & Min. temperature and
sunshine.

January 1883:      * RAIN 'entered for preceeding day.'
	'For 1883 see the ''Hourly readings'' Published by the
	Meteorol. Office.'

	3256 & 3254 mounted in a new screen exactly East of the new
	Robinson Dome.  'For corrections see the end of this book.

	'New 8in. raingauge to be read at 9.0h in future & to be
	entered on large sheet in column: 'RAIN'.  This 8in. gauge
	replaced the square on the lawn. There is no reference to a
	change in Kew gauges as is referred to in Sheelagh Grew's
	article in I.A.J. Vol. 1 @ 1950.

May 11 1885

Mar. 26 1942					Ref.p.358 M.C.
(From Met. office to Armagh Obs.)

	'With reference to the duration of rainfall records for
1941..., two points arise:
	(1) It appears that you tend to over estimate the duration of
rainfall according to the standard adopted in this Office. A
comparison for a few days is given below:-

			1941.		Hours and tenths, 0-24 hours
				     Your value.  Value measured in M.O.
		December 6th		5.4		4.2
			 7th		5.1		4.9
		
			1942.
		January  2nd 		1.6		0.6
			 5th		1.4		0.8
			15th		8.8		5.2

	'It is noticed that a duration of one hour is frequently
credited to a fall of 0.1mm. For example, there are four such entries
on form 3440 for 15th January, 1942. An examination of the charts
shows that in one case 0.1 hour, is the appropriate entry for
duration. In the other two cases the fall was at a less rate than
0.1mm/hour and neither duration nor amount should be entered.
	'The procedure is to count as duration only that part of the
curve which shows the rain to be falling at a rate of .004in. or
0.1mm. or more per hour. It would be helpful if you would adopt this
procedure....'


May 22 1942				Ref.p.357 M.C.
(From Met. office to Observatory)

	'...we have now examined the rainfall charts for March and
April 1942. Our measurements are substantially less than those made at
the Observatory, as the following comparison shows:-

		Month		Total Duration Measurements
				By observer	By M.O.
				  (Hours)	 (Hours)

		March		  96.5		  75.1
		April		  75.8		  53.7


	'It is noticed that on form 3440 there are still repeated
cases of one tenth of a millimetre being credited with a complete
hour's duration. This would have led to an even greater degree of
error in the total duration for March, but for the fact that the
number of hours with rain was reckoned as being 2.4 and 2.9 for March
4th and 5th respectively. The correct amounts of entries on form 3440
are, however, 12.4 and 10.9 hours...
	'With regard to your climatological return for March 1942,
made on form 3202, it was found that the rainfall entries on six
occasions did not agree with the check gauge readings entered on
charts and form 3440. We have therefore corrected the record for the
days in question.'

whereas other records received show that more than 4in fell during the
month almost everywhere in Northern Ireland. At the nearest stations
to Armagh- Tynan Abbey and Richhill - the totals were 5.10 and 4.55in
respectively. Possibly the gauge sprung a leak during the recent
severe frosts...kindly have it tested in the manner described..
	'The Beckley recorder generally shows larger amounts than the
check gauge, thus confirming the latters deficiencies.
	'Unfortuneately the Dines Tilting Syphon gauge does not seem
to be functioning properly. The too regular rise of the traces on
rainy days suggests that the funnel may be partly choked,allowing rain
to percolate only slowly into the container...'

June 7 1947				Ref.p.296 M.C.
(From Armagh Obs. to Met. Office)

	'There was definitely an error in the March rainfall. The
raingauge itself was free from leaks but it was the method
of measurement which introduced the error. It was customary to measure
with an 8-inch measuring  glass which meant that the amount in the
check gauge was " as read" and the amount in the 12-inch was
halved. This 8-inch measuring glass was broken and a 12-inch was
used. Instead of reading the Beckley as read and doubling the 8-inch
the above procedure was conitnued . Consequently the March rainfall
should be doubled.
	'We have asked for some time now for a new measure
glass. Unfortuneately a 5-inch glass has been sent but there seems no
sign of this being replaced.
	'As regards cards for the Beckley, the pen was broken and when
a new one was requested the wrong type of nib was received the Beckley
was put into operation.
	'The Dines Tilting Syphon has never functioned properly since
it was received. It has caused us a great deal of worry  and
trouble. Occasionally the funnel gats choked but this is only a minor
nuisance. The two faults are (1) the pen will not keep contact with
the drum and (2) the float will often, for no apparent reason, rise
and stick there and record rain when none has fallen. The amount
recorded seems to bear no relationship with either of the other two
gauges. There is no point in operating the gauge in its present
state. If there is anyone at Aldegrove familiar with this type of
gauge I would appreciate a visit from him.'



July 1 1947				Ref.p.294 M.C.
(From Met. Office to Armagh)

	'In regard to the Dines Tilting Syphon gauge it appears from
your account that it may have been dismantled and re-assembled with
the float out of its guide. Also the collar on the lid of the float
chamber has probably been bent out of position, thus causing excessive
friction between it and the pen arm rod. The gauge will have left here
in a satisfactory state...
	'A measure for the 8 inch gauge has been on order since March
1946 and there is still no prospect of delivery.
	'If you give the amounts of rainfall as measured and give
details of the diameter of the collecting surface and the type of
measure used, there should be no difficulty in securing reasonable
values for the ordinary gauge.'


Sept. 3 1947				Ref.p.292 M.C.
(From Met. office to Armagh)

	'I should like to get satisfactory rainfall values  for
January to March 1947 for Armagh... I am still not clear as to your
difficulties and we have had no reply to our letter of July 1st.
	'We have... the rainfall records as supplied on form 3202 and
should like to know how these are obtained and why there was a change
from mm. to inches after Dec. 31st, 1946. We want to know what were
the original readings January - March and what factor was applied, and
how they are being obtained a present.
	'Do you need a measure for an eight-inch gauge graduated in
mm. or inches? We can supply one graduated in inches but there will be
a delay in supplying one in mms. In fact, the 8 inch measures in
mms. are going out of supply because the standard gauge used by the
office is now 5 inches. We could... replace the 8-inch gauge by a
5-inch gauge and indeed shall have to when the 8 inch gauge becomes
defective.'

	'...The rainfall as we calculated it for January to March was
as follows:-
		January		1.51"
		February	0.63" (melted snow)
		March		2.89"

	'As was explained to you in our letter of June 7 these
rainfall values should be doubled. In late December the 8" measuring
glass was broken & a 12" was used. In measuring the former the
rainfall value was "as read" and the rainfall in the Beckley was
halved. After the 8-inch glass was broken and the 12-inch introduced
the rainfall in the check should have been doubled and the Beckley "as
read" but the previous procedure was continued, consequently the
calculated rainfall for these three months should be doubled. The
8-inch glass was measured in mm. and the 12-inch in inches so when the
former got broken the rainfall was calculated in inches and not in mm.
	'We have received an 8-inch glass graduated in inches. At
present we measure the rain in the check with this glass "as read" and
halve the Beckley.
	'The Dines Tilting Syphon is still out of operation. In our

inspection.
	'1. Rain-gauge. This in rather poor condition, the tube having
become completely detached from the funnel. As it is an old gauge it
is proposed to replace it by a new 5in. gauge and measure. When these
are received... return the old 8in. gauge and its measure...

	'1.Raingauge. The 8" raingauge, although in poor condition,
works without loss of rain water and will be repaired. This raingauge
has been used as standard in calibrating the rainfall over 100 years
at the Armagh Observatory and it is not considered advisable to change
it by another of a different size and elevation above the ground which
would involve systematic effects of turbulence near the ground and
possibly a systematical difference in the rainfall. If it is to be
replaced it is desireable to have an 8-inch gauge of the same
dimensions and not a 5-inch as proposed. Enclosed is a study of
rainfall which explains the reason.
	'2. Autographic raingauge. The obstruction in the funnel tube
is of minor consequence. It is easy to clear it but the major defect
which the inspector did not mention is in the failure of the recording
device to register small amounts of rain. THis cannot be repaired
by our own means and it is desirable to have an officer fom your
Aldegrove Office to come and examine it. It cannot be used now.'

	'..Your desire to continue using an 8-inch gauge is
appreciated. Unfortunately we no longer stock this size of gauge and
efforts to locate a serviceable second hand one have so far proved
unsuccessful. It is suggested that the existing gauge be repaired and
retained in use for the present.
	'The following extract from "The rain gauge in theory and
practice" an article which appeared in British Rainfall, 1910, may be
of interest. "Experiment has shown that, with a suitably graduated
glass, a rain-gauge of any diameter can give accurate results; but a
very small quantity of water goes to a hundreth of an inch of rain
over a 3-inch circle (only 17.85 grains) and the loss of a few drops
makes a rather serious error. On the other hand with a rain-gauge of 8
inches diameter, in which one-hundreth of an inch amounts to 127.4
grains, the quantity of water collected after a heavy fall of rain is
sometimes inconveniently large. The tendency during the last fifty
years has been towards the use of 5-inch circular rain-gauges, the
only other size at all frequently used being 8 inches in diameter".

Armagh as soon as possible to examine the Autographic raingauge.'

        Various notes from a file entitled "Revised Max/Min Temperatures
        with time-dependent thermometer corrections" by CJB.
        
        Note on cover "Note error in 1848 mean minimum in the earlier dataset
        used in the plots published in Solar Physics 152 p35-42, 1994 - this
        error was not present in the revised (1996) dataset published in J. for
        Atmosph. and Terr. Phys. 1996
        
        
        Recalibration of thermometers
        
        Max,Min 
        Comparison of max, min with the AWS (Automatic Weather Station) for
        1869, 1881 reveals a broadly similar trend for the two years with some
        evidence for larger errors in the max in 1881 than in 1869.
        
        The maximum and minimum temperature-dependent correction curves do not
        overlap and cannot be superimposed by sliding vertically - therefore
        they probably represent errors  in the thermometers rather than the AWS
        thermograph.
        
        The calibration should be improved with additional years observations
        during the period 1874-1882.
        
        
        External Thermometer
        
        After 1860 the external thermometer used was the 'Kew Standard' - does a
        calibration exist for this thermometer in the Met. Office records ?
        
        Comparison of the external thermometer and AWS (which was probably
        calibrated with reference to the same thermometer) at the times the
        external thermometer was read, i.e. am and pm, shows for the years 1874,
        1882 reasonably consistent results for pm but significantly different        
        results for am at the high temperature end. A check to see if this
        corresponded to early morning sunshine, showed no correspondence.
        
        As no obvious explanation presented itself and the differences seemed
        rather large to be attributed to the 'Standard Thermometer' it was
        decided not to make any correction to the external thermometer in case
        the AWS results were inaccurate. One possible explanation might be that
        the external thermometer which was mounted on the tower still measured
        higher that the air temperature at 10:30 am due to a thermal hysteresis
        effect associated with the adjacent stonebuilding. However one would
        have expected the building to be cooler than the air at this time of day
        rather than warmer.

        thermograph curves made at points two minutes before each hour corrected

        Indication of inaccuracies in thermograph readings prior to 1874
        
        "The production of the volume for 1874 has been delayed by various
        circumstances, among the most important of which has been the necessity
        of preparing fresh tabulating scales for the thermographs at several
        observatories, those originally supplied having been found insufficent
        in exactness, owing to the fact that such scales cannot be prepared with
        the requisite accuracy until a considerable mass of observations,
        extending over a wide range of temperature, has been accumulated"

        Plot of Ser I (mean of "spot" temperatures, converted to mean of Max 
        and Min) against Ser II (Revised Mean of Max/Min) for the years
        1844-1881.
        
        Note: (1) No apparent difference with decade, (2) General shift with Ser
        I cooler than Ser II by approx. 0.1 degs. C, (3) 1862 is anomalous with
        either: Ser I too warm by 1 deg C,  or Ser II too cool by 1 deg C.
