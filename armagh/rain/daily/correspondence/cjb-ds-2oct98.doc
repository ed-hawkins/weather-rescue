Dear David,

This is the first of what I expect to be a series of notes about the
reorganisation of the meteorological data and our attempts to make it more
widely available over the Internet. We are really grateful to your offer to
help with this, as its one of those activities which has received occasional
attention, but has never been completed due to the pressure of events. 

The most disorganised of all the data-sets is that pertaining to rainfall. This
is principally because the data as it stands has been computerised in a
piece-meal fashion by various different agencies, including the Met Office, the
Planetarium and summer students at the Observatory, but also because, during
the 19th C. several guages were kept in operation at any one time and data has
been taken from different guages at different times. 

To deal with our general requirements, first, most of which will be obvious to
you: 

(1) We need to be sure that the raw data files that have already been
entered into file are accurate. For this it is necessary to check the data
entered into the file with the tabulated material in the original record books.
This does not need to be done for every entry, though this would be desirable,
but random samples do need to be checked. The original record books have been
photocopied and we can lend you the photocopies, volume by volume, so that you
can do this at home, if you wish. We cannot allow the original record books to
leave the Observatory and if you need to consult them, they must be returned to
the archives at the end of the day. 

(2) We have started a file of metadata, that is material concerning the setting
up of the recording instruments, their location, calibration information, dates
when put into and taken out of use, failures, breakages, times of observation
etc; indeed anything about the data which has been recorded. Much of this
information has been recorded at the beginning or end of the record books, but
some is found in the comments column beside the daily data itself. Any such
information needs to be recorded in this file in chronological order.
Eventually it will be a very long file, containing all we know about our
meteorological observations, except the data itself. Currently, the file is
called metadata.lis and can be copied from the following directory
/home/cjb/met/rain/david . As you go through the copies of the record books,
when you spot information on the instruments, please check that the information
has been recorded in the metadata.lis file, and if not please amend the
metadata.lis file accordingly. In addition to the information in the record
books themselves, we are also compiling any information in the form of letters
to and from the met office, other material relating to the meteorological
records which is in the archives etc. Eventually, we will want to print all
this material in a book along with cross-references and a classified index, so
if you can think of a way of including along with each item a reference field
which would make this easier (and hopefully automatic) later, then please feel
free to suggest how it could best be done. The types of categories I am
thinking of would be "max and min temperatures, wet and dry temperatures,
rainfall, sunshine etc". One could consider a numbering system, but one has to
allow for the insertion of extra items throughout the series as they are
discovered. Keywords, against each item, might also be useful. They could be
encrypted, of course, for brevity.

(3) Once the raw (that entered in the record books) data has been checked, then
begins the tedious and often unstisfactory business of establishing what
corrections need to be applied for instrumental error, change of observing time,
change of observing method or whatever. Occasionally, though I think not often,
corrections have been applied before the data has been entered into the book.
Its crucial to know, of course, when this has been done and what "correction"
was applied, as we may in the light of subsequent information want to undo that
correction and apply a better one. With the rainfall guages, we are in a
reasonably satisfactory position, as many of the guages have been kept operating
for a while to provide some overlap. Unfortunately, this procedure did not
continue right through the series, in particular in more recent times. Anyway,
once one has settled on a calibration of the instrument then the correction
needs to be applied, instrument by instrument, before amalgamating the files in
to a single homogenous file. At all stages we need to keep a complete record of
what has been done to each dataset in its progress from raw data to
"homogeneous" data. In the past we have tended to do this by including some
extra records, either at the beginning or end of the file, to alert the user to
the histor of the data listed. We should standardise this procedure.

(4) Once the daily data files have been corrected for instrumental error etc
and put into a single homogeneous system, then begins the statistical part.
Firstly, we need the monthly, seasonal and annual mean totals. In our earlier
paper on rainfall we used mean daily rainfall per month, season etc, but one of
the referees was not so happy about this and asked for totals to be given. As
it seems this is standard, we should use totals rather than mean daily per
season etc in future. By the way the seasons, go Dec/Jan/Feb, Mar/Apr/May,
Jun/Jul/Aug and Sep/Oct/Nov so the winter season for a year includes the
December of the previous year, whereas the annual total includes all the months
(J-D) of the year in question. In addition to these monthly, seasonal and
annual totals I would like to form totals on shorter time intervals in a
non-calendar way, which is more amenable to comparison with other sorts of
astronomical/geophysical data, such as cosmic ray fluxes etc. As non-leap years
have 365 days, successive five-day totals would probably be useful for this
reason. The successive five day bins, would be numbered 1-73, and the central
day of each bin, be expressed in decimal parts of a year. For example the time
axis for bin 2 in 1998 would be the midpoint of the second bin in the year
(i.e. day number 8) 1998.0225. Barbara Bromage, a colleague at the University
of Central Lancashire is particularly interested in data bins on this sort of
time-scale to compare with cosmic ray data. She has some evidence that rainfall
in Ireland and Northern Britain is influenced by the position of the storm
tracks and these in turn are influenced by solar proton events. The five-day
bins would be of about the right length to see these effects.

(5) We need to look at extrema in the data. This is often for the benefit of the
public, who like to know when was the wettest, the driest etc and when records
are broken. In meteorology there are so many records that they are broken
regularly. To take rainfall as an example, these extrema are: wettest day on
record, driest day on record, wettest and driest days in any given month on
record, wettest and driest months on record for each month throughout the year,
wettest and driest seasons and years etc. Many of these records will probably
change as a result of the homogenisation of the data. In the past, the recorded
values have often been used for extrema without correction.

(6) There is a lot of statistical information that can be determined once the
homogeneous data file is available. We should look for trends, cycles,
comparison with other data such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Nino
as well as geophysical and astronomical data. It would also be useful to have
such statistics as the number of days in the year during which rain was
recorded, the rainfall on days of the week and days of the month. Just for fun
we could look at the 40 days following St Swithin's Day. 

(7) There are other items recorded in the meteorological data comments column
that are of interest, such as the presence of Aurorae or high latitude luminous
clouds. A file containing the dates and comments would be worth compiling, for
instance in order to assess the level of solar activity. Eventually, these too
should be published. 


FILES
*****

Now to look at the individual files of data in chronological order.


*****************************************************************************
1838-1853    directory: /home/cjb/met/rain/raw  filename: r.dly38-53

Contains rainfall in inches, recorded by Square Guage (S1) on Roof Data format:
X = month, y = date,  -9999 should indicate that data does not exist but often
it has been used, incorrectly, when no data was detected (i.e. a dry day). Up to
1845 - 6 characters per field, from 1846 5 characters per field.

Note the following missing data points, (check for others):

1842 Apr      -    these data points probably should not have been given -9999,
they are probably just dry days on which no rain was recorded - suggest that
these values are changed to 0.000

1849 May      -    some S1 data missing, suggest using the Round Guage data
instead, make sure that corrections are applied for correct guage.

1850 Jan/Feb   -   use 0.000 for days when the guage was frozen, the observer
should have thawed the ice and the recorded it, but we can assume that he left
it to be included in the following days rain, so the totals should not be
affected.

1851 Nov/Dec  -    S1 leaked from Nov 1851 till 27 April 1852, (this fact should
be recorded in the metadata) Use the data from the Round guage, with the
relevant correction.

1852 Jan/Feb/Mar/Apr  - Use Round Guage data with correction

1853 Jan/Feb/Mar/Dec  - frozen guage, assume 0.000 and that water remains until
first mild day.

Correction factors: S1 multiply by 1.31, R multiply by 0.85



******************************************************************************
1853(Nov)-1861(Mar 9)  directory: /home/cjb/met/rain/raw   file: sq1+sq2.53-61 

Guages S1 and S2, S1 was placed on the Roof and S2 on the N. Lawn, 
units  - inches

Format: First year - Nov/Dec only, x = month, Y = Date, two data points per day
- upper value is from S1, lower from S2.

I would suggest that this file be separated into two files, one for S1 and one
for S2. The correction factors are: S1 1.31, S2 1.00.

The year for 1857 is incorrect.

A number of entries show -9999 which should be 0.000 for reasons as above.

For the whole of this period the Round Guage has also been recorded - this has
not been entered onto file, but should probably be done at some stage.

For the homogeneous data set we have previously used S2 where it is available,
rather than S1, as the position of S2 is more similar to modern requirements.

However, it might be of interest to look at both sets of data independently, as
the data has been already entered onto computer. Unless there are any compelling
reasons to do otherwise, it would probably be wisest to use the S2 data for the
homogeneous data set, as previously.

******************************************************************************

1861-1865   This data was never enered onto computer. The square gauge data from
S2 needs to be entered in. Round Guage data is also available.

*******************************************************************************

1865 (apr) - 1978   directory: /home/cjb/met/rain/raw   file: uea-rain

Format: x = date, y = month,  data is in mm x 10

origin: Univ. of East Anglia, typed in by unknown agency - probably Met Office
Two similar files accompanied this file from the UEA, one of maximum
temperature and the other minimum. The temperature files contained numerous
errors and are not considered useable. This file has been found to be
relatively accurate, however, it contains data from different guages and
contains no information as to which guage was used at any particular time. 

The file has been looked at by David Fee and compared with the record books. He
was able to identify which parts of the data belonged to which instrument. He
also noted that for prolonged periods the data is given one day ahead in the
file to that recorded (probably for the reason that the rainfall was read in
the morning and so mostly fell on the previous day). However, for consistencey
with other data files, I suggest that we bring the data back to the day on
which it is read.

From 1865-Mar 1874 the data is from the Round Guage, even though the square
guage S2 has been read. For consistency with the previous datset we should
probably produce a new file for this period which contains the S2 data. The Kew
Guage has been used from 1874-1880, once again the possibility of using the
sgaure guage S2 should be looked into. From 1880 - 1964 sometimes the 8-inch
has been used and sometimes the Kew Guage. Both should be reasonably accurate,
but one or the other could be suspect at any particular time due to faults.
This needs to be checked out in the metadata and the record books etc. In the
mean data that is currently being published by the Royal Irish Academy, the
mean monthly data for the period 1885-1964 has been taken from the 8-inch
guage. Bearing in mind the inacuracies we have found in the UEA files and the
constant switching from one guage to another perhaps we should consider whether
we should take up the offer of help by QUB Dept of Agriculture to compile the
data for 1865-1978 again, using only S2 and the 8-inch (I) guage.

**************************************************************************

1951-1987    directory: home/cjb/met/rain/raw  file rain1951-1987

data in mm ,  up to 1963 8-inch (I), from 1964 5-inch (J), check metadata for
exact date of change, x = month, y = date

From a few spot checks, this data looks reliable.

**************************************************************************

1988-1995    directory: home/cjb/met/rain/raw   file: ARM88-95

data in mm, 5-inch guage (J)

Format x = datafield Max, Min Rain etc for Jan, Feb, Mar
       y = date
       
Origin: the Met Office. It may be possible to get the updated file from the Met
Office to complete this to 1998. In future we hope to set a procedure to update
our homogeneous data file at the end of each month.
