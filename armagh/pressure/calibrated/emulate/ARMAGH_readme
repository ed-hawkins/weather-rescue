		   MSLP series used in EMULATE
_______________________________________________________________________________


Two MSLP series for each station series used in EMULATE are provided.  
These correspond to 'uncorrected' and 'corrected' series; the 'corrected 
series was used to create the daily MSLP product for work package one. The  
corrections will be described in detail below.  Firstly, the format of the
files  is described. 
______________________________________________________________________________

1. Format

Each file is in ascii format.  There are two lines of header information.  
The first line is the station name (including the directory). 

The second line contains some important station details:  
station_number, first_year, last_year, latitude, longitude, station height

eg. For  La Coruna

  8001  1865  2002   4316   -850     58
  
The series then follows with 
year, month, day, pressure 


Notes:
* the pressure is at mean sea level and is given in hPa.
* missing MSLP values are given as   -999.90
* if there is no station number, it is given 99999
* station height is given in metres
* if no details of station height were available, we used the height given in 
  the WMO records
* if a change of height was known, we took an average of the heights. 
* latitudes are in degrees (not degree and minutes) x 100.  For example: 
  45 degrees N, 30 minutes = 45.5 x 100  => 4550
  43 degrees N, 15 minutes = 45.25 x 100 => 4525
* longitudes are in degrees (not degrees and minutes) x 100.  West is denoted  
  by negative values.  For example, 
  30 degrees E, 12 minutes = 30.2 x 100 => 3020
  10 degrees W, 55 minutes = -10.92 x 100 => -1092

2. 'Uncorrected' series 

These files are denoted by the file ending : .ts.asc 
For example for Armagh the filename is: 

emulate_armagh.ts.asc

Although they are classed here as 'uncorrected', many of these stations have 
undergone considerable quality control (eg. WASA, IMPROVE stations, Durham, 
Armagh etc).  We call them 'uncorrected', because we (at the Hadley Centre)  have
applied minimal corrections.  
Minimal corrections refers to  correcting  typos, calculating the
daily average, filling in missing data points in a couple of stations (using a
different source) and reducing Hohenpeissenberg, Jena, Milan and Athens to mean
sea level.   NOTE: Rob also applied considerable QC and near neighbour checks 
for the Armagh series (refer to his email).

3. 'Corrected' series

These files are denoted by the file ending : .ts.diurnal.adj.asc
For example for Armagh the filename is :
emulate_armagh.ts.diurnal.adj.asc

Firstly we apply a correction for the diurnal  and semi diurnal oscillation.  We
use the phase and amplitude fields (seasonal)  calculated by Dai and Wang (1999)
to estimate the diurnal & semi diurnal cycle at each  station.  Observation
hours for each day of a station series have been produced  and these are then
used to determine the appropriate adjustment, given the cycle.   Due to a lack
of sufficient sub-daily data, we were unable to calculate  the diurnal and
semidiurnal cycle at each station directly.  The Dai and Wang fields are on a
5x5 degree latitude longitude grid and hence we interpolate  the nearest grid
point to our station.  It is rather a crude adjustment, however  corrections are
generally small and, as stated above, it was not possible to estimate  diurnal
waves  directly for each station in this project. 

Secondly, we adjust the series such that the monthly mean is equal to a
reference monthly mean (either the corresponding ADVICE station series, that 
interpolated from the nearest ADVICE  grid point, or from the nearest HadSLP
grid point)**.   Specifically, the monthly means are calculated from the daily
series and compared  to the reference ADVICE/HadSLP monthly value.  The
difference in  monthly means is then used to adjust the daily SLP values.  There
was some concern  about jumps in adjustments at the end of each month, so a
slight smoothing  was applied to the monthly adjustments.  Preference was given
to the ADVICE station  series where possible, however in some cases problems
were found with the ADVICE  station series.  In these instances, the ADVICE
gridded value was used. 


** ADVICE is a available as a monthly gridded MSLP product from 1780-1995  
   and as individual monthly station series (see Jones et al, 1999)
** HadSLP is a gridded monthly MSLP product developed at the Hadley Centre 
   from 1871-1998

4. Remaining issues

We do still have come concerns about the quality of a number of series.  To
properly  quality control 86 stations would require more than time allocated to
the whole of  the EMULATE project.  Because the data would undergo further
quality control in  the gridding procedure, we decided to proceed with the
stations series as they stood.   For research being conducted with individual
station series, we would recommend  however that some caution to be exercised. 

Any feedback would be extremely useful!
