John,
       This is an e-mail I sent to Ana last year which will give you
additional details on what we did with the Armagh series.  You should
also get an e-mail from Tara soon that is a copy of what she sent to Ana
too.

                                                     Cheers,  Rob.

&gt; Dear Rob,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; It's been a year almost that we haven't heard from you and I have almost<BR>
&gt; finished my PhD here at Armagh. I guess you are working on something else<BR>
&gt; at the moment, but before I leave, we would like to know if you finished<BR>
&gt; the checks on the Armagh series from the daily pressure data.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; We also would like you to tell us in a sequence of steps (if you can and<BR>
&gt; remember) what you have done to standardized the Armagh pressure series<BR>
&gt; (daily and monthly). This is to be included in a small paper including the<BR>
&gt; data (not for peer review) but more importantly to be able to include the<BR>
&gt; pressure data onto our web page. We got a grant for this project which<BR>
&gt; established that we had to make the data available to the public. I think<BR>
&gt; we discussed this already.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Maybe you want to write the paper, but I would understand if you prefer not<BR>
&gt; to. In that case we will do it. The idea is to follow the same structure as<BR>
&gt; my rainfall paper that was circulated among libraries and research centres<BR>
&gt; in the UK (I think you had a copy of it). This is to describe the series,<BR>
&gt; the methods to standardize the data (daily and monthly) and finally include<BR>
&gt; the data in tables. However, you may be preparing a paper that includes<BR>
&gt; your work with the Armagh pressure series. We don't have any problem with<BR>
&gt; that if you acknowledge the Armagh Observatory. In that case, we also need<BR>
&gt; to have a paper written that describes the standardized data as I detailed<BR>
&gt; above.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Please let me know what you think and if you had the time to finished the<BR>
&gt; calibration of the daily data.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Regards,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Ana<BR>

Ana,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry that I haven't got back to you before now - I've just got<BR>
back this week from a month's leave.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month my colleague Tara Ansell completed our QC efforts on<BR>
daily MSLP data for Europe, including the Armagh series, for our<BR>
EC-funded EMULATE project.&nbsp; I did the QC work on the daily Armagh<BR>
series, primarily for 1851-1881 by plotting them against other daily<BR>
pressure series we had for Ireland - i.e. Valentia, Galway, Greencastle,<BR>
Roches Point, but also looked at the monthly means calculated from the<BR>
daily data against the monthly means we had in our Archives etc for much<BR>
of the record.&nbsp; This helped throw up a few questionable daily readings.<BR>
I checked any odd values against the electronic file values for Armagh<BR>
daily pressure that are on your WWW site, and corrected where<BR>
necessary.&nbsp; There were not that many corrections required.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monthly Armagh series was checked independently and earlier<BR>
against long series for Dublin, Valentia and Edinburgh.&nbsp; That threw up a<BR>
few discrepancies.&nbsp; Together with the daily data, it was evident that<BR>
running Armagh against the majority of pressure fluctuations from<BR>
'nearby' stations in Ireland quickly showed up whether there were<BR>
problem values - in Armagh or one of the other Irish ones.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tara Ansell will forward to you the Armagh daily MSLP series.&nbsp; In<BR>
addition to details of the QC procedure,&nbsp; we can provide you with two<BR>
versions of the station series (one that had been QC-ed by me as above<BR>
and also the final EMULATE version, complete with the corrections to the<BR>
ADVICE data).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the paper that you mentioned on the Armagh data,<BR>
we're both flat out here - back on the monthly global pressure data for<BR>
the next version of our historical global gridded MSLP product HadSLP.<BR>
In addition, I'm also in the throes of trying to put together a large<BR>
proposal for the latest EC-funded FP 6 call.&nbsp; So if you could do the<BR>
first draft of the paper, we'd look to iterate with you on it to develop<BR>
a final version.&nbsp; The EMULATE project here would simply use the Armagh<BR>
series along with 80 odd others for Europe in the daily MSLP<BR>
compilation. So you can concentrate on your paper effort concerning the<BR>
Armagh series with our input, and there won't be any major overlap with<BR>
what goes in any publications from EMULATE.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that this helps.&nbsp; Cheers,&nbsp; Rob.<BR>
