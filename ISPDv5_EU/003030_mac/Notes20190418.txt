Hello Yin,

 

Sorry for the delay in responding as I was away. Please find attached a corrected file which replaces 
the file 'Collec 3030 TOD79_03.txt' (originally submitted on 26 January 2016).

 

Corrections were made to all records with the year 1879, which in fact should have been 1878. However, 
some of the station IDs are missing in this file (recorded as '1.00E+13'). We have found some of these 
station IDs, which I have attached separately. Mac thought you might already have a script for updating 
station IDs. If not, please let me know.

 

Regards,
