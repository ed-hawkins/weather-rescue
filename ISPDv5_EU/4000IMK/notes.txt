Dear Yin,

This is the pressure series from Karlsruhe, 1778-2008, originating from the German Weather Service (post 1875) and the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
Contact person is: Christoph Kottmeier [christoph.kottmeier@kit.edu]

This is a long and important series and it would be nice if it could still be included into the ISPD v5 release.

Best regards,
Stefan Brönnimann

Hi Gil,

the best is to name our data "Karlsruhe climate series, station database of the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology".

The series include not only pressure, but several other observations such as temperature, wind, precipitation, cloudiness etc.

Thanks and best regards
Michael
