HI Linden,

Thanks for more data! Also thank you for making it the same format, this will save me a lot time dealing with 
various formats.

I saved together with the UERRA data.  But do you think we need a separate bank-id for this part of the data?  
If so please let me know the collection name and contact information so I can create one.

Best regards.

Hi Yin,


Yes, this will be a separate data source. These observations have come from a small group of volunteers at the 
University of Newcastle in Australia, and I think we will have more observations to come in the next 12 months. 


You can put me as a contact person for now (lindenashcroft@gmail.com is the best address). 
Original images are located here: http://libguides.newcastle.edu.au/digitalscriptorium/belfield. 
The working collection name is Team ALGERNON - Archiving Landowner and Grazier Efforts to Record 
Numerical Observations across New England.


Many thanks,


Linden

Hi again Yin,


Could you also add my collaborators as contacts for the Algernon dataset?

Hi Yin and Gil,

 

I hope you had a great Easter break!

 

Apologies for not answering your query Yin. This should be a separate bank-id, not the Bureau. 
I think I contacted my collaborators about a suitable collection name to give, but we never landed on one. 
The most sustainable information would be:

 

Collection Name: University of Newcastle Cultural Collections

Contact details: Gionni Di Gravio (gionni.digravio@newcastle.edu.au), 
Linden Ashcroft (linden.ashcroft@bom.gov.au), 
Howard Bridgman (howard.bridgman@newcastle.edu.au).

 

All the best,

 

Linden
