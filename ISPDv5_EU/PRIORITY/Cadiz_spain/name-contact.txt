Yin and Rob,

Going through old emails, I found this daily SLP series that Rob had forwarded from Spanish colleagues. The series is documented in the paper

Gallego, D., R. Garcia-Herrera, N. Calvo, and P. Ribera (2007), A new meteorological record for Cádiz (Spain) 1806–1852: Implications for climatic reconstructions, J. Geophys. Res., 112, D12108, doi:10.1029/2007JD008517.

When I originally received the data from Rob, I assumed it was a daily-average series, and I am pretty sure I never sent it to you.

Going back through the paper, I see that the observations are actually for the time of  "sunset".  I think you have already thought about how to assign UTC to this time specification?

From the paper and metadata in the text file, the data have already been reduced to SLP and corrected for standard gravity. The pressure data are estimated to be from

45 m above sea level

at location

36º31'56''N
 6º17'54''W

The series should go under the individual series collections with the tentative name
Universidad Pablo de Olavide Cadiz, Spain series

contact
David Gallego (dgalpuy@upo.es)

Rob, would you contact Dr. Gallego to see if this "collection" title is appropriate?

best wishes,
gil
