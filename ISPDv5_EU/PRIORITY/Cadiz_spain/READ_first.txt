Dear Dr. Allan,

Regarding the series for Cadiz, the data contain SLP (already corrected by gravity and reduced to Sea Level) and temperature (in Celsius) from January 1st, 1825 to December 31th, 1852.

Data were taken at local sunset. So if a time-tag is necessary, the astronomical sunset at the station's coordinates should be taken (maybe converted to UTC?). Please, let me known if you want me to provide you additional information on this (such an additional column with the UTC time).

The location of the observatory is

Latitude: 36º31'56''N
Longitude 6º17'54''W
Height: 45 m AMSL

The observations were done in a tower called "Torre Tavira" which is very close to the center of Cadiz. So a suitable name for the series could be:

"Torre Tavira observatory, Cadiz, Spain"

Unless the name of the institution which produced the series must be included in the title, I think the chain "Pablo de Olavide University" should not appear in the series name because that university is in Seville (about 100km from Cadiz). It could be confusing for the user.

Thank you for your interest and please, contact me for any question.

David Gallego
Universidad Pablo de Olavide
Seville, Spain.
