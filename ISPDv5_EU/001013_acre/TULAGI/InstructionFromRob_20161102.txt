Yin,

          I think that I have finally sorted out the historical weather data for 
Tulagi in the Solomon Islands that I sent to my Swiss colleagues to get digitised 
under their citizen science effort.

 

          I really don’t know what happened, but the first four years of the 
series 1/1909-12/1912 were a mess in the files that they sent back from the 
digitisation – especially the pressure data!!!! 

 

         So I will again give you access to the Tulagi file on my Drop Box 
to get the data.  The thing to do is to use the TULAGI.xlsx file for the 
1/1909-12/1912 Attached Temperature and Uncorrected Pressure values 
(columns D and E)(noting the change in barometer height ASL from 53.6m 
from 1/1909 to 7/1910 to 2.1m from 8/1910), then you’d have to extract 
and reformat as a continuous series built up from each of the pieces of 
the data that they did in blocks for the first, second and third 
(10, 10, 10/11) days of each month in the export_So5_all.xlsx to 
export_So13_all.xlsx files – I think you will see what I mean.   
I’d note that all the columns for all of the other variables jump 
about, and I didn’t do anything about that in the TULAGI.xlsx file.   
So after that, from the 1/1913 onwards, you should be able to pick it 
all up in the files export_So5_all.xlsx to export_So13_all.xlsx in the 
form that I just mentioned. 

 

         I hope that this is not too much of a hassle for you.  Let me 
know if you strike any problems or my directions above don’t make sense.

E-mail part 2:

Yin,

       OK good luck with that.  I’d mention that one thing that I did 
notice as I looked through the export_So5_all.xlsx to export_So13_all.xlsx 
files in the later years is that they give two different sets of 
observations for each of the blocks of 10, 10, 10/11 days, and looking 
at the original scans I found out that they are for 1600 and 1200 hours 
observations (so 2x daily) and in that apparent reverse time order???    
Nothing is marked to indicate this of course…….    Note also that the 
export_So5_all.xlsx to export_So13_all.xlsx files are not necessarily 
in time order – so it is all a jigsaw puzzle….  Sorry about this, I will 
not be sending any further data series to my Swiss colleagues to be 
digitised.   Cheers,  Rob.
