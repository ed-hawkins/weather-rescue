Hi Yin and Gil

 

I found other digitised data from us for which I am not sure if I have sent them to you, sorry for any duplication

 

cheers

I am attaching the following stations:

Astrakhan: For the period 1866-1880 and the variables Barometer, Temperature. The barometer seems to have different units for the period 1866-1870 compared to 1871-1880. Also the amplitude in temperature is larger after 1870 but most probably is due to the change of time the observation was taken.
Nertchinsk: For the period 1839-1861 (wind direction 1839-1845). I am expecting more data (till 1880) from Christos in the next weeks, I just decided to sent these period since it was completed. The digitization was in a very good quality but it contained some mistakes so it took some time to quality control it. I think its normal due to the numerous data this station had for some years (hourly data) and the lack of monthly-daily mean (for quality control). Altitude and wind-explanation-signs are not available in the scans.
Criminal Prison Observatory: For the year 1905.


NOTE from Yin:
The files with "complete" in names were received in 11/06/2014 from 
Athanasios Tsikerdekis <atsikerdekis@gmail.com>

They seem to have difference from my rough check.
