Dear all,

 

please find attached the (not quality controlled) SLP-data of 15 signal 
stations at the North and Baltic Sea coasts (1877-1939). It would be very 
nice and helpful for us, if you could make a quality check with your routines. 
You can find the SLP-data in the columns PPPP. I am looking foreward hearing from you.

 

Yours
