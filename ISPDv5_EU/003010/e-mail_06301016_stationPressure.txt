Dear Gil, dear Xungang Yin,

 

please find attached the historical pressure data of DWD of the Pacific Islands. The pressure is on station level (not SLP). The coordinates and heights of the stations are listed in the xls-file. I also added a description of the data in German, the English version will be ready in July.

 

If you have any questions, please contact me.

 

Yours

Birger
