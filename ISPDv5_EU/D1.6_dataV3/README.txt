Hi Yin,

 

As in the case of our data provision to ECA&D, changing the name to
 “C3/UERRA/MEDARE dataset of synoptic observations” could solve the 
problem without creating a new id. Only thing to modify is the contact 
name as: Linden Ashcroft and Manola Brunet, since the important thing 
is that C3/URV is acknowledged.

 

Best!
