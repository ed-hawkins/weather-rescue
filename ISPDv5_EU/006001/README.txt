Hi Scott,
 
Attached please find the "Fram" data digitized in Excel format. Data are saved under each station for each variable. Please read metadata or readme file for data description under each variable directory.

Please feel free to let me know any problems with the data.
 
Have a nice day,
 
Judy

Hi Judy,
 
Please send the digitized data in Excel spreadsheets to Scott Woodruff (he is cc'd on this email). Gil will ask him to convert them to ICOADS format. Thanks.
 
Cheers.

Xiaolan,

Have you had a chance to correspond with Scott Woodruff on getting the "Fram" observations into ICOADS? They would need to be converted to IMMA format.
Scott Woodruff <Scott.D.Woodruff@noaa.gov>

(can you tell I am doing follow up on old emails? :-)

best wishes,

gil
