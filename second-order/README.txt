SPREADSHEETS SPLIT BY YEAR PROVIDED BY MET OFFICE ARCHIVES (Catherine Ross)

Notes:
- April 1875 is missing
- September to December 1878 have some incomplete sheets
- October 1879 has some incomplete sheets

- Lots of sheets have data where the average of the daily values does not match the monthly mean tabulated. Many of these will be typos which still need to be fixed.

- Books for 1873-1874 only include data for Birr Castle and have not been prioritised for digitisation.
