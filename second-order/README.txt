SPREADSHEETS SPLIT BY YEAR PROVIDED BY MET OFFICE ARCHIVES (Catherine Ross)

Notes:
- Lots of sheets (1893-1899) have data where the average of the daily values does not match the monthly mean tabulated. Many of these will be typos which still need to be fixed.

- Books for 1873-1874 only include sub-daily data for Birr Castle and have not been prioritised for digitisation.
